  - Leveling panel
  - X Twist compensation
  - Direct entry of values with an on-screen keyboard

## 4.0.6 (2020-02-23)

* **#236** - platformio.ini file contained a configuration to upload the firmware using a Dragon AVR programmer
* **#235** - Sometimes, message displayed on Wait screens was wrong
* **#234** - Some actions should be disabled during a print
* **#232** - Fan speed in Preset was not saved in EEPROM

## 4.0.5 (2020-01-20)

* **#230** - During pause (both normal and advanced), wait a moment just after purging the nozzle
* **#229** - Publish a firmware to clear the EEPROM (to use when it is corrupted)
* **#228** - Sometimes after flashing, the LCD screen displays distorted images
* **#227** - Mark II: 4.0.4 Auto bed leveling stuck at homing
* **#226** - Printer freeze when using BLTouch Y offset >= 8
* **#223** - Disabling beeps does not work with some LCD displays
* **#219** - After stopping a print the X, Y, and Z axis will all move when Z jog is pressed
* **#218** - Fix (again) "(L,R,F,B) out of bounds" error
* **#217** - Y axis jogs itself on first G0/G1 after power on

## 4.0.4 (2019-12-30)

* **#224** - Fix ghost touch with BLTouch 3.1. See note bellow
* **#218** - Fix "(L,R,F,B) out of bounds" error
* **#215** - Sometimes after flashing, the LCD Panel displays a version mismatch warning

**Note**: 

* **#224** is not really a bug but more a vibration problem with the printer itself or the mounting support.
This release tries however to minimize the occurrences of such ghosts touches. As a consequence, the G29 sequence is slower.
I will change that in version 4.1.0 to make the sensor parameters configurable. 

## 4.0.3 (2019-07-11)

### Removed features

* **#162**: XYZ Motors "calibration". It was wrong. It gives the false impression that this part needs some calibration when in fact, these parameters (number of steps per millimeter) are directly derived from the mechanical parts of the printer (the stepper motor, ...)

## 3.0.2 (2018-06-10)

### New features

* **#138** - Simplify the build of a BLTouch release with Arduino IDE

### Bug fixes

* **#126** - ABL stops at random heights with same g-code
* **#132** - Bug: cannot set sensor/nozzle height lower than -2 mm bug
* **#133** - The default steps (X, Y, Z and probably E) are wrong
* **#136** - When a setting is wrong (such as jerk equals to 0), reset it to the default

## 3.0.1 (2018-05-31)

### Bug fixes

* **#128**: Jerk values were wrong for Z and E axis
* **#129**: It was not possible to confirm Factory Reset

## 3.0.0 (2018-05-25)

### New features

* BLTouch support (Classic and Smart). Clones of BLTouch are not supported (and I recommend to avoid them)
* [#8], [#18]: M600 support and head parking
* Pause, Resume and Stop when printing from USB
* Z-height in status (near the fan speed, in green)
* Display messages on Home screen
* Thermal Runaway enhancements: Now displays why the printer was stopped. You can also choose to disable thermal protection. At your own risk. I recommend to let it on.
* USB baudrate: you can now choose the baud rate. It is 115200 by default (like in the previous versions)
* Buzzer control: You can now disable or enable the buzzer from the LCD panel. The buzzer is now off by default when you press the screen, but does but for some actions (load and unload for example).
* Screen Dimming control: You can now disable or enable the dimming of the LCD panel and choose its intensity.
* **#82**: Change slightly colors for a better contrast
* **#102**: Declare thermal protection capability
* **#103**: In settings stored in EEPROM are not compatible, warn the user and reset settings to factory

### Bug fixes

* **#15**: Will not x-home if you cancel a print and then restart. Very annoying but not easy to fix
* [#84]: SD Card (Print menu): Directories are displayed like if they were files
* **#37**, #97, #118: Filament loading/unloading stops when requested
* 121 Manual moves (X, Y and Z) are now smother

* [#31](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp/issues/31): Stop, Pause and Resume are not working when printing from USB. (*Note: functionality removed in this version*)
* [#32](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp/issues/32): Back button is not working in PID tuning page 


## 1.0.1 (2017-10-25)
