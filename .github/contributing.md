## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a Bug Report for **ADVi3++**. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a Bug Report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](issue_template.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** Regressions can happen. If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like your issue, go ahead and open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. All you need to create a link is the issue number, preceded by #. For example, #8888.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Use the New Issue button to create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the template](issue_template.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets or log output in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots, links to videos, etc.** which clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **Include G-code** (if relevant) that reliably causes the problem to show itself.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of **ADVI3++**) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of ADVi3++ are you using?** ADVi3++'s exact version and build date can be seen in the LCD Versions screen.
* **What kind of 3D Printer are you using**?

### Suggesting Features or Changes

This section guides you through submitting a suggestion for **ADVi3++**, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating a suggestion, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](issue_template.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting a Feature Request

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp/issues?q=is%3Aissue)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Feature Request?

Feature Requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please follow these guidelines in your request:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the requested feature** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and links to videos** which demonstrate the feature or point out the part of ADVi3++ to which the request is related.
* **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most ADVi3++ users.
* **Name other firmwares that have this feature, if any.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests can either be targeted to the advi3++ branch or to development branches (e.g., `advi3++dev`). If this is your first Pull Request, please read Github's [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) documentation.

* Fill in [the required template](pull_request_template.md).
* Don't include issue numbers in the PR title.
* Include pictures, diagrams, and links to videos in your Pull Request to demonstrate your changes, if needed.
* Document new code with clear and concise comments.
