## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a Bug Report for **ADVi3++**. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a Bug Report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](issue_template.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> [!NOTE]
> Regressions can happen. If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like your issue, go ahead and open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. All you need to create a link is the issue number, preceded by #. For example, #8888.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Use the New Issue button to create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets or log output in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots, links to videos, etc.** which clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **Include G-code** (if relevant) that reliably causes the problem to show itself.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of **ADVI3++**) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of ADVi3++ are you using?** ADVi3++'s exact version and build date can be seen in the LCD Versions screen.
* **What kind of 3D Printer are you using**?

### Suggesting Features or Changes

This section guides you through submitting a suggestion for **ADVi3++**, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting a Feature Request

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp/issues?q=is%3Aissue)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Feature Request?

Feature Requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please follow these guidelines in your request:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the requested feature** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and links to videos** which demonstrate the feature or point out the part of ADVi3++ to which the request is related.
* **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most ADVi3++ users.
* **Name other firmwares that have this feature, if any.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests can either be targeted to the advi3++ branch or to development branches (e.g., `advi3++dev`). If this is your first Pull Request, please read Github's [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) documentation.

* Fill in [the required template](pull_request_template.md).
* Don't include issue numbers in the PR title.
* Include pictures, diagrams, and links to videos in your Pull Request to demonstrate your changes, if needed.
* Document new code with clear and concise comments.
