# ADVi3++, an advanced and better firmware for Wanhao i3 Plus Printers

## Introduction

**ADVi3++** is a fork of the [Marlin Firmware](http://marlinfw.org/) for the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus (and its clones: Monoprice Maker Select Plus, Cocoon Create, ...). It includes both Marlin itself and screens for the LCD Panel.

Working on **ADVi3++** takes a lot of time and effort. I make my best to release good quality software, useful and precise documents. I track bugs reported by users and replies to help requests. I invest also time and money to implement new hardware features.

If you like what I am doing, please consider supporting me as a supporter on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=6504486) so I can continue and develop new releases and new documents. Supporting this project is a guaranty for you that it will continue and become better and better.

## Objectives

The objectives with this custom version (when compared with Wanhao stock firmwares) are the following:

* Based on the latest version of Marlin available (currently: 2.1.1)
* As few modifications of the Marlin code as possible. The goal is to be able to port **ADVi3++** to new versions of Marlin with only a few effort.
* Open source firmware (GPLv3 like Marlin).
* Object-oriented code with as few hard-coded values as possible. For example, instead of constructing a frame by hand, use instances of classes that know how to construct themselves.
* Use latest C++ features and technics including metaprogramming.
* Documented code, logging and error handling (without using exceptions as they are not supported).
* Full color and nice LCD screens (CC BY-NC-SA).
* Support of hardware such as the BLTouch sensor for automatic bed leveling, filament runout sensors, ...

## ADVi3++ User Manual

# Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus

I have posted an article on my web site: [Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus 3D Printer - Everything I know about the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus 3D printer and its clones](http://sebastien.andrivet.com/en/posts/). It contains several technical information about the printer internals.

# Thanks

* Thanks to [Dylan xKoldx](https://github.com/xKoldx/ADVi3pp-Marlin) and [weidercs](https://github.com/weidercs/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for their forks supporting BLTouch. Thanks to Matt Cowell [SureshotM6](https://github.com/SureshotM6/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for the fork supporting M600 and head parking.
* Thanks to Leo LÃ¼ker (Silverquark) for his [i3plus+ project](https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus). I take many ideas from his code. But the project is no more active and I do not like the screens (personal taste) so I have created the **ADVi3++** fork. It is technically a fork of Marlin, not of i3plus+.
* Thanks to [MarlinTeam](http://marlinfw.org/) for their great work.
