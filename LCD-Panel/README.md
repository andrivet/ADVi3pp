# ADVi3++ LCD-Panel Screens

## Introduction

The LCD panel of the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus printer is manufactured by AMP Display Inc. and uses Mini DGUS (DWIN Graphic User System) developed by DWIN Technologies.

There are currently (at least) two different models of LCD panel:

* DMT48270M043_05WT
* DMT48270M043_02WT

The programming of the LCD Panel is described in *DWIN MINI DGUS Display Development Guide*, only available in Chinese. I have translated it partially and may release the translation in the future.

The MINI DGUS Display can be flashed by using its microSD slot. The microSD card contains a set of files such as images of pages, fonts, etc.

## LCD-Panel Screens Sources

The actual source for the LCD-Panel screens is the file `ADVi3++5 LCD-Panel.sketch` created with [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) currently only available for macOS.
Images in PNG format are derived from this Sketch file and are then converted to the appropriate format for the LCD Panel.
