<<<<<<< HEAD
A new beta version is avaiable.
Look under the Marlin_v1 branch. We also made a tag that you can download.















This firmware is a mashup between Sprinter, grbl and many original parts.
 (https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter)
 (https://github.com/simen/grbl/tree)

Features:
 - Interrupt based movement with real linear acceleration
 - High steprate
 - Look ahead (Keep the speed high when possible. High cornering speed)
 - Interrupt based temperature protection
 - preliminary support for Matthew Roberts advance algorithm 
   For more info see: http://reprap.org/pipermail/reprap-dev/2011-May/003323.html

This firmware is optimized for gen6 electronics.

The default baudrate is 250000. 
This gives less communication errors then regular baudrates.

========================================================================================

Configuring and compilation


Install the arduino software version 0018
   http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Install the sanguino software, version 0018
   http://sanguino.cc/useit

Install pronterface
   https://github.com/kliment/Printrun

Copy the Marlin firmware
   https:/github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin
   (Use the download button)

Start the arduino IDE.
Select Tools -> Board -> Sanguino 
Select the correct serial port in Tools ->Serial Port
Open Marlin.pde

Change the printer specific setting in Configuration.h to the correct values.

The following values are the most important:
 - float axis_steps_per_unit[]....         // Set the correct steps / mm in the corresponding field
 - const bool ENDSTOPS_INVERTING = false;  // Change if only positive moves are executed
 - #define INVERT_x_DIR true               // Change if the motor direction is wrong

Click the Upload button
If all goes well the firmware is uploading

Start pronterface

Select the correct Serial Port. Type 250000 in the baudrate field.
Press the Connect button

===============================================================================================
Known issues

On some systems we get compilation errors.

This is caused by the "wiring_serial.c" and "wiring.c".
The simple fix is to delete these files but this may have a performance impact.

The best workaround is to move these files to sanguino directory. 
(".../arduino-0018/hardware/Sanguino/cores/arduino/" on windows systems)





=======
This RepRap firmware is a mashup between Sprinter, grbl and many original parts.
 (https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter)
 (https://github.com/simen/grbl/tree)

Derived from Sprinter and Grbl by Erik van der Zalm.
Sprinters lead developers are Kliment and caru.
Grbls lead developer is Simen Svale Skogsrud.
It has been adapted to the Ultimaker Printer by:
Bernhard Kubicek, Matthijs Keuper, Bradley Feldman, and others...


Features:
 - Interrupt based movement with real linear acceleration
 - High steprate
 - Look ahead (Keep the speed high when possible. High cornering speed)
 - Interrupt based temperature protection
 - preliminary support for Matthew Roberts advance algorithm 
   For more info see: http://reprap.org/pipermail/reprap-dev/2011-May/003323.html
 - Full endstop support
 - Simple LCD support (16x2)
 - SD Card support
 - Provisions for Bernhard Kubicek's new hardware control console and 20x4 lcd

This firmware is optimized for Ultimaker's gen6 electronics (including the Ultimaker 1.5.x daughterboard and Arduino Mega 2560).

The default baudrate is 115200. 


========================================================================================

Configuring and compilation


Install the latest arduino software IDE/toolset (currently 0022)
   http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Install Ultimaker's RepG 25 build
    http://software.ultimaker.com
(or alternatively install Kliment's printrun/pronterface  https://github.com/kliment/Printrun_)

Copy the Ultimaker Marlin firmware
   https:/github.com/bkubicek/Marlin
   (Use the download button)

Start the arduino IDE.
Select Tools -> Board -> Arduino Mega 2560 
Select the correct serial port in Tools ->Serial Port
Open Marlin.pde

Click the Verify/Compile button

Click the Upload button
If all goes well the firmware is uploading

Start Ultimaker's Custom RepG 25
Make sure Show Experimental Profiles is enabled in Preferences
Select Sprinter as the Driver

Press the Connect button.

KNOWN ISSUES: RepG will display:  Unknown: marlin x.y.z

That's ok.  Enjoy Silky Smooth Printing.
